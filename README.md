# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
 In this project, I used 2020 US election tweets to work on the sentiment analysis. The analysis covers several important economic attributes, such as diversity, income, population and etc.
 There are two main files in this despository. The jupyter notebook contains all the codes used to do the analysis. The pdf contains the finished paper for the results.
